# JavaCodeNote
A JavaFX-based application.
By running this app, users could easily take notes by clicking the terminal on the homepage.
The application has multiple features that allow users to take notes by adding images, programmable codes, markdown, etc.

We also build another project, which allow users to design their own homepage.
